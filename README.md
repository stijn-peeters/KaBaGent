_This readme and repo where created as part of an exercise during the BeCode web-developer course._

## Create a responsive website

### How we chose our project

We had a couple of options to choose from, refresh a local store's site, create one from scratch or design one for a small community.

The project we choose was to Redisign one of our teammember's old website.
This gave us a chance to use the previous content of the site.

## Generate a proper GitHub repo

### Why we are on GitHub

GitHub is the main platform BeCode uses, our deployment strategy will rely on the GitHub pull-request system to ensure no accidents happen.

### GitHub license choice

We used a MIT [LICENSE](./LICENSE.md) as it fits our needs perfectly.
